        <b>Ravioli</b> is a type of Italian pasta consisting of small, square or
        circular pockets filled with various ingredients. The filling can be
        made from a variety of ingredients such as ricotta cheese, spinach,
        mushrooms, meat, or even seafood. The pasta dough is typically made from
        flour and eggs, rolled thin, and then cut into shapes, with the filling
        placed in the center before sealing the edges to form a pouch. Ravioli
        is usually served with a sauce, such as marinara, butter and sage, or a
        rich cream sauce, and is a beloved dish in Italian cuisine, often
        enjoyed as a comforting, hearty meal.

      <h3>Recipie:-</h3>
      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>For the Pasta Dough:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>A pinch of salt</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>Water, as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the Filling:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
          <li>1 cup fresh spinach (or frozen spinach, thawed and drained)</li>
          <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For Cooking:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Salted water (for boiling the ravioli)</li>
          <li>Sauce of choice (such as marinara, butter and sage, or pesto)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h4>Instructions:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Pasta Dough:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            On a clean surface, make a mound with the flour and create a well in
            the center.
          </li>
          <li>
            Crack the eggs into the well, add the salt and olive oil. Using a
            fork, gently whisk the eggs and slowly incorporate the flour from
            the sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the mixture begins to form a dough, knead it by hand for about
            10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is
            too dry, add a little water, one teaspoon at a time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30
            minutes at room temperature.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Prepare the Filling:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            While the dough is resting, cook the spinach. If using fresh
            spinach, sauté it in a pan with a little olive oil until wilted
            (about 2-3 minutes). If using frozen spinach, make sure to squeeze
            out any excess water after thawing.
          </li>
          <li>Let the spinach cool and then chop it finely.</li>
          <li>
            In a bowl, mix the ricotta, spinach, parmesan, nutmeg (if using),
            and salt and pepper. Stir until well combined and set aside.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Roll Out the Dough:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into two equal pieces.</li>
          <li>
            Using a rolling pin or pasta machine, roll out each piece of dough
            into thin sheets, about 1/16 inch thick. Make sure to keep the
            surface lightly floured to prevent sticking.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assemble the Ravioli:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lay one sheet of dough flat on a clean surface. Place small
            spoonfuls (about 1 teaspoon) of the ricotta-spinach filling about 1
            inch apart across the dough sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brush the edges of the dough and around the filling with a little
            water (this helps seal the ravioli).
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay the second sheet of dough over the top and press down around
            each mound of filling to seal the edges.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a knife or a ravioli cutter to cut out individual ravioli
            squares, pressing the edges to ensure they are sealed completely.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Cook the Ravioli:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
          <li>
            Gently drop the ravioli into the boiling water, being careful not to
            overcrowd the pot. Cook the ravioli for about 3-5 minutes, or until
            they float to the surface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a slotted spoon to remove the ravioli from the water and set
            them aside.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Serve the ravioli with your favorite sauce. A simple butter and sage
            sauce works beautifully—melt butter in a pan, add fresh sage leaves,
            and cook until fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>Top with grated parmesan and enjoy your homemade ravioli!</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h4>Tips:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can also make ravioli with different fillings like mushroom, meat,
          or even butternut squash.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a smoother texture, use a pasta machine to roll the dough,
          especially if you want to make the sheets very thin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leftover ravioli can be frozen. Simply freeze them on a baking sheet
          before transferring to a bag, and cook them directly from frozen when
          ready to eat.
        </li>
      </ul>
