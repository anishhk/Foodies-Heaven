        <b>Dosa</b> is a popular South Indian dish that has gained worldwide
        recognition for its crispy texture and savory flavor. It is a type of
        thin, crepe-like pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and urad
        dal (split black gram). The batter is spread thin on a hot griddle,
        creating a golden-brown, crispy outer layer while remaining soft on the
        inside. Dosas are often served with a variety of chutneys (like coconut,
        tomato, or mint) and sambar, a spiced lentil soup. Whether enjoyed as a
        breakfast, snack, or dinner, dosa is a versatile and flavorful dish that
        has become a beloved part of Indian cuisine.

      <h3>Recipie:-</h3>
      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>For the Dosa Batter:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup rice (preferably idli rice or short-grain rice)</li>
          <li>1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
          <li>
            1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional, helps with fermentation)
          </li>
          <li>Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For Cooking Dosa:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ghee or oil (for greasing the pan)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h4>Instructions:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Soaking the Rice and Dal:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Rinse the rice and urad dal separately in water.</li>
          <li>
            Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in a bowl and the urad
            dal in another bowl. Soak both for at least 4-6 hours or overnight
            for better fermentation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>2. Grinding the Batter:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>After soaking, drain the rice and dal.</li>
          <li>
            In a blender or wet grinder, grind the urad dal with some water
            until you get a smooth, fluffy batter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, grind the rice and fenugreek mixture with enough water to make
            a smooth batter, but it should have a slightly coarse texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix both the rice and dal batters together in a large bowl and add
            salt to taste.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>3. Fermentation:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cover the batter with a clean cloth and allow it to ferment in a
            warm place for 8-12 hours, depending on the temperature of your
            environment. The batter should rise and become bubbly when properly
            fermented.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>4. Making the Dosas:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Heat a flat non-stick pan or cast-iron griddle (tawa) over medium
            heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once hot, lightly grease the surface with a cloth soaked in ghee or
            oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour a ladleful of batter in the center of the tawa and quickly
            spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drizzle a little more ghee or oil around the edges of the dosa to
            make it crisp.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the dosa cook on medium heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the edges
            begin to lift and turn golden brown. You can flip it if you prefer
            both sides crispy, but traditionally, dosas are cooked on one side
            only.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serving:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Serve the dosa hot with chutneys (coconut, tomato, or mint) and
            sambar, or even a potato filling for a Masala Dosa.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h4>Tips:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the batter is too thick after fermentation, add a little water to
          achieve a pouring consistency before cooking the dosas.
        </li>
        <li>
          For crispy dosas, ensure the batter is spread thinly on the tawa.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can store leftover batter in the refrigerator and use it within
          2-3 days.
        </li>
      </ul>
